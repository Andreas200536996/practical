        <h2>My achievements</h2>
        <div id="text">
        <p>I have acquired my Grade 9 in Conservatory Canada Piano, while also doing my schooling.</p>
        <p>Completing up to Grade 9 piano has taken great dedication as I have had to put hours a day into practicing
            and performing my songs.</p>
        <p>I have also recieved an award for obtaining the #1 grade in all of Canada the year I completed my Grade 4
            piano exam.</p>
        <p>Along with my piano I also maintained high grades throughout school aswell.</p>
        <p>The dedication I show in my Piano and school is only a fraction of what I will show at your company, I am not
            one to shy away from a challenge and I always follow through and finish what I start.</p>
